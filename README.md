👋 Hello! I’m Amina, a Software Developer with a deep love for creating robust applications using Python and Django. I pride myself on delivering solutions that make life easier for users and more efficient for businesses.

🚀 My journey in software development has seen me mentoring junior developers and interns, guiding them on best practices in Python, Django, and PostgreSQL. My role involves conducting code reviews, providing constructive feedback, and fostering a collaborative environment where everyone can grow and contribute effectively.

💻 As a software developer , I took the lead on HRMS projects, developing intuitive systems with comprehensive dashboards to enhance user experience. My work extends to designing high-performance databases with PostgreSQL, ensuring data is stored and retrieved efficiently.

🌟 One of the highlights of my experience is deploying applications on AWS and cPanel, making sure they are reliable and efficiently maintained. These deployments were crucial in ensuring the scalability and robustness of ERP systems and dynamic websites.

📈 I’ve also worked extensively with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, improving the UI/UX of applications to ensure a seamless user experience. My backend expertise includes working with Django REST framework, developing APIs, and user authentication features.

🤝 I'm a team player who values effective communication and collaborative work environments. Keeping our projects on track and our team cohesive is something I cherish greatly.
